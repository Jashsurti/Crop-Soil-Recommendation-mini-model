# Crop-Soil-Recommendation-mini-model
This project is a Crop/Soil Recommendation System for Kerala farmers. Using soil nutrients, pH, rainfall, temperature, and soil type, it predicts the most suitable crop with a Random Forest model. The prototype shows how personalized, data-driven advice can boost yield, improve decisions, and support smallholder farmers.
